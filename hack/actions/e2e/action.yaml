# GitHub action to run the E2E tests.
# For this purpose, it would be a better idea to use a reusable workflow. There
# is some documentation about how to use a local reusable workflow:
#   https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-25-github-actions-reusable-workflows-can-be-referenced-locally/
# But it seems it doesn't work properly:
#   https://github.community/t/allow-reusable-workflows-to-be-located-at-arbitrary-locations-and-be-local/212745/7
# So, the CI uses a local GitHub action as a template to run all the tests.
