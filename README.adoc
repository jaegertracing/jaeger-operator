= Jaeger Operator for Kubernetes
:toc:

WARNING: this is still work in progress. The YAML files mentioned here might (or will) change without notice.

== Installing the operator

NOTE: Make sure your `kubectl` command is properly configured to talk to a valid Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have one yet, check link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[`minikube`] out.

To install the operator, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
----

At this point, there should be a `jaeger-operator` deployment available:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get deployment jaeger-operator
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
jaeger-operator   1         1         1            1           48s
----

The operator is now ready to create Jaeger instances!

== Creating a new Jaeger instance
The simplest possible way to install is by creating a YAML file like the following:

.simplest.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: io.jaegertracing/v1alpha1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simplest
----

The YAML file can then be used with `kubectl`:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f simplest.yaml
----

In a few seconds, a new in-memory all-in-one instance of Jaeger will be available, suitable for quick demos and development purposes. To check the instances that were created, list the `jaeger` objects:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get jaeger
NAME        CREATED AT
simplest    28s
----

To get the pod name, query for the pods belonging to the `simplest` Jaeger  instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods -l jaeger=simplest
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
simplest-6499bb6cdd-kqx75   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

Similarly, the logs can be queried either from the pod directly using the pod name obtained from the previous example, or from all pods belonging to our instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl logs -l jaeger=simplest 
...
{"level":"info","ts":1535385688.0951214,"caller":"healthcheck/handler.go:133","msg":"Health Check state change","status":"ready"}
----

For reference, here's how a more complex all-in-one instance can be created:

.all-in-one.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: io.jaegertracing/v1alpha1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: my-jaeger
spec:
  strategy: all-in-one # <1>
  all-in-one:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.6 # <2>
    options: # <3>
      log-level: debug # <4>
      memory: # <5>
        max-traces: 100000
----
<1> The default strategy is `all-in-one`. The only other possible value is `production`.
<2> The image to use, in a regular Docker syntax
<3> The options to be passed verbatim to the underlying binary.Refer to the Jaeger documentation and/or to the `--help` option from the related binary for all the available options
<4> The option is a simple `key: value` map. In this case, we want the option `--log-level=debug` to be passed to the binary.
<5> Some options are namespaced and we can alternatively break them into nested objects. We could have specified `memory.max-traces: 100000`.

== Accessing the UI

The operator creates a Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[`ingress`] route, which is the Kubernetes' standard for exposing a service to the outside world, but it comes with no Ingress providers by default. link:https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#verify-installation[Check the documentation] on what's the most appropriate way to achieve that for your platform, but the following commands should provide a good start on `minikube`:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/nginx-0.18.0/deploy/mandatory.yaml
minikube addons enable ingress
----

Once that is done, the UI can be found by querying the Ingress object:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME             HOSTS     ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
simplest-query   *         192.168.122.34   80        3m
----

In this example, the Jaeger UI is available at http://192.168.122.34

== Removing an instance

To remove an instance, just use the `delete` command with the file used for the instance creation:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f simplest.yaml
----

Alternatively, you can remove a Jaeger instance by running:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete jaeger simplest
----

NOTE: deleting the instance will not remove the data from a permanent storage used with this instance. Data from in-memory instances, however, will be lost.

== Uninstalling the operator

Similar to the installation, just run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
kubectl delete -f deploy/rbac.yaml
----
