= Releasing the Jaeger Operator for Kubernetes

1. Prepare a changelog and get it merged. A list of commits since the last release (`v1.8.0` in the following example) can be obtained via:

  $ git log --format="format:* %s" v1.8.0...HEAD

1. Test!

  export BUILD_IMAGE_TEST="${USER}/jaeger-operator:latest"
  export BUILD_IMAGE="${BUILD_IMAGE_TEST}"
  make all

1. Tag and push

  git checkout master ## it's only possible to release from master for now!
  git tag release/v1.6.1
  git push git@github.com:jaegertracing/jaeger-operator.git release/v1.6.1

1. Apply generated OLM catalog files to operatorhub.io

* Retrieve the auto-generated operator manifests, e.g. `git pull upstream master`
* Clone the https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operatorhub] repo
* Apply the following changes to https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/community-operators/jaeger[community-operators/jaeger] and https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/upstream-community-operators/jaeger[upstream-community-operators/jaeger] in separate PRs:
  - overwrite the file `jaeger-package.yaml` from `deploy/olm-catalog` in jaeger-operator repo
  - copy the `jaeger.clusterserviceversion.yaml` and rename to include the version, e.g. `jaeger.<version>.clusterserviceverson.yaml`
