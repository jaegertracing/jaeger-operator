commands:
  # Before executing the KUTTL tests, the Jaeger Operator is deployed in the
  # observability namespace. To run this test, we modify that
  # deployment modifying the container image to use (that is the same executable
  # but compiled using a different version number). For that reason, the test
  # is not isolated. TODO: task #1575.
  #
  # The 01-assert.yaml file is generated by the prepare-e2e-kuttl-tests make
  # rule. It will try to assert the Jaeger instance uses the next container
  # version
  - script: "kubectl apply -f operator-upgrade.yaml -n observability"
