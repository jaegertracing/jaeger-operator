commands:
  # As explained in previous steps from this E2E test, this test is not totally
  # isolated. So, to decrease the impact of #1575, the original configuration
  # of the Jaeger Operator is applied here
  #
  # The 02-assert.yaml file is generated by the prepare-e2e-kuttl-tests make
  # rule. It will try to assert the Jaeger instance uses the current container
  # version (the one used before the change in the Jaeger Operator)
