commands:
  # Before executing the KUTTL tests, the Jaeger Operator is deployed in the
  # observability namespace. To run this test, we modify that
  # deployment modifying the container image to use (that is the same executable
  # but compiled using a different version number).
  # The 01-assert.yaml file is generated by the prepare-e2e-kuttl-tests make
  # rule. It will try to assert the Jaeger instance uses the next container
  # version
