# Releasing the Jaeger Operator for Kubernetes

1. Update Jaeger version in `versions.txt`

1. Make sure the new version is present at `pkg/upgrade/versions.go`

1. Prepare a changelog since last release. Get the `OAUTH_TOKEN` from (Github)[https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=GitHub%20Changelog%20Generator%20token] and select `repo` scope.

    ```
    OAUTH_TOKEN=... make changelog
    ```

1. Commit version change and changelog and create a pull request:

   ```
   git commit -m "Preparing relase 1.16.0" -s
   ```

1. Tag and push

    ```
    git checkout master ## it's only possible to release from master for now!
    git tag release/v1.16.0
    git push git@github.com:jaegertracing/jaeger-operator.git release/v1.16.0
    ```

1. Wait until release CI job finishes and then pull the changes:

    ```
    git pull git@github.com:jaegertracing/jaeger-operator.git master
    ```

1. Apply generated OLM catalog files to [operatorhub.io](https://operatorhub.io)

    * Clone the [operatorhub](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators) repo
    * Run `make operatorhub`
      - If you have [`hub`](https://hub.github.com/) installed and configured, it will open the necessary PRs for you automatically. Hint: `dnf install hub` works fine on Fedora.
      - If you don't have it, the branches will be pushed to `origin` and you should be able to open the PR from there
