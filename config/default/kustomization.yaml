namespace: observability

# Value of this field is prepended to the
# names of all resources, e.g. a deployment named
# "wordpress" becomes "alices-wordpress".
# Note that it should also match with the prefix (text before '-') of the namespace
# field above.

# The prefix is not used here because the manager's deployment name is jaeger-operator
# which means that the manifest would have to contain an empty name which is not allowed.
